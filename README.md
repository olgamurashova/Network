## Network

### General information:

The Network class is used to track how much total data and how many users each network has.
The properties of the Network class are:

+ data: Total units of data supplied by the network
+ users: Total numbers of users currently on the network

Each user on average deducts 5 units from the network’s total data. To watch a movie a user must connect to a network that has at least 10 remaining units of data. A method movieTime() added to the Network class returns true if there is enough data available to watch a movie, false if there isn’t.
